          <h3>My Dogs</h3>
          I have two dogs, Nani and Boo. Most days when its sunny I like taking
          them to the dog park, its right by there moms work so we like seeing
          her during lunch and by the water. Its very relaxing to go for a swim
          with them or watch them play and meet new people.

          <h3>Military</h3>
          I spent just over 8 years in the military. The US Air
          Force was an awesome expirience and I am glad I was able to serve. My
          job in the USAF was a Firefighter. I was stationed at JBLM in Tacoma,
          Washington, and my second year there the fire department decided to go
          all contract to civillians. That allowed me to get stationed at Eglin
          AFB in Ft. Walton Beach Florida. I have spent the last 6 years here
          and I dont think I will ever leave.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          I began my Journey on a wimb. I knew I didnt
          want to continue being a fireman any more and stumbled upon Web
          Development. After researching it and seeing the job outlook for the
          next few years I decidided to try it out. To be honest, I thought it
          would be more of a job than a career, but once I started I really
          started to enjoy and love logging on and created new projects and
          learning new skills!
